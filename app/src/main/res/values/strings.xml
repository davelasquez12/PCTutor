    <string name="step2_01">1. Click one of the dropdown arrows for the category where you think
        the problem lies. For example, if your monitor is experiencing some issue, a good option
        to try is the Monitors category. Click on the arrow next to Monitors.</string>

    <string name="step2_02">As shown in the picture below, your device name should now show up.</string>
    <string name="step2_03">2. Right click on the device name and a little menu is displayed. Click
        on “Update Driver Software…”</string>
    <string name="step2_04">3. A new window opens up as shown in the picture below. Click the
        first option that says “Search automatically for updated driver software”.</string>
    <string name="step2_05">4. Windows will now search online for any updated device drivers the
        selected device may need. The search should complete in about a minute, more or less.\n\n
        If an updated driver is found for the specified device, it will automatically begin
        downloading and installing which could take anywhere from a few seconds to five minutes.
    </string>
    <string name="step2_06">5. After installation is complete, the window below will now show (with
        your device’s name specified instead).</string>

    <string name="step2_07">6. Restart your computer and test out the malfunctioning device.
        90% of the time, this will fix the issue. If your problem is resolved, congratulations
        you no longer have to read this guide. But if no driver was found or if your problem
        persists even after a driver was installed using this method, there is still one more
        thing you can try.</string>
